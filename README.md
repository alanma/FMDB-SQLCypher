# FMDB-SQLCypher
After long hours of suffering, searching for a simple example on how to get my current SQLite database and encrypt using SQLCipher and FMDB, I was able to work on a code that is simple and it works! 


You need to remember to create a sqlite model file and copy it to the Xcode "Bundle Resources".
